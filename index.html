    <hr><h2>Introduction</h2><hr>

    <p>The American economy has been transformed in the last three quarters of a century—and no change has been more profound than the shift from manufacturing to services. In 1940, one in three non-farm jobs were in manufacturing—building durable and non-durable goods for (largely) domestic consumption. That share jumped briefly during World War II, reaching a high of 38%; but after the war ended, the share of manufacturing in total employment has declined steadily. In 2016, less than one in ten jobs in America had to do with manufacturing goods.</p>

    <p>Even in absolute numbers the changes are staggering. In 1940, 9.5 million people who worked in manufacturing; in 2016, it was 12.4 million. At the same time, total jobs in the entire economy grew from 32 million to 144 million. Put simply: the American economy created 112 million jobs between 1940 and 2016; of those, only 2.2 million were in manufacturing. Durable goods to be exact—meaning machines, vehicles, aircraft, and the like; employment in non-durable goods—such as food processing, beverages, paper, plastics—is actually lower than in 1940 even in absolute terms.</p>

    <p>This decline in manufacturing has various political, economic and social repercussions (some real and some perceived). I am not going to explore these here. Rather, I am interested in a narrower question: what do American workers do instead? If not manufacturing, what? And why does it matter?</p>
   	
    <hr><h2>Employment by Sector: The Big Picture</h2><hr>

    <p>TThe answer depends on the data we use. Are we interested in employment only are do we want to consider unemployment or even people who are no longer looking for jobs? Are we interested in total jobs (what jobs people have) or are we interested in change (what jobs are more important now than before)? How detailed do we want to be? Are "manufacturing" or "education and health" even meaningful groupings, or should we be talking about how many people work in bakeries or junior colleges or offices of dentists? Different approaches give slightly different answers.</p>

    <p>Let's begin with the big picture on employment: the relative decline in manufacturing jobs has been totally offset by the rise in three sectors: professional and business services; education and health services; and leisure and hospitality. (These groupings only capture private-level jobs; they exclude jobs at state and local schools, universities or hospitals, for instance.). The share of manufacturing jobs went from 31% in 1940 to 9% in 2016, a decline of 23 percentage points; by contrast, these three sectors jumped from 17% to 40%, also a rise of 23 percentage points. In effect, the American economy has moved from manufacturing goods to education, health, professional business services and leisure.</p>
    
          <div><h3>Employment by industry (as percent of total)</h3>

               <p class = 'graphFootnote'>Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics</p>
          </div>

    <p>These three sectors have grown rapidly. In absolute terms, their trajectories are similar; but after 1990, education and health overtook the other two and built a lead—especially after 2005, as education and health jobs have experienced fewer ups and downs due to changes in economic activity.</p>

    <p>But what exactly do these sectors mean? Is it education or health that is driving change? Leisure or hospitality? The data to answer this question is more limited—we don't have very detailed sub-sector information back to 1940. But we have good detail since 1990—and investigating the data for that period can still answer many of the broad questions that matter.</p> 

    <p>To begin with, since 1990, the American economy added about 34.8 million jobs—and these three sub-sectors accounted for 78% of those jobs (27.2 million). In other words, these three sectors explain the bulk of the growth in jobs over the past 26 years.</p> 

    <p>Let's dig deeper. The groups below are somewhat arbitrary—they don't follow a strict statistical convention and they show data at different aggregation levels. I have avoided groupings that are too vague to be meaningful ("professional services") as well as groupings that are so narrow one misses the big picture ("offices of chiropractors"). These groups are a balance between those extremes.</p> 

    <div><h3>Employment by select sub-sectors (in millions)</h3>
    <div class = 'graph' id = 'employmentbyTopEight'></div>
    <p class = 'graphFootnote'>Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics</p>
    </div>

    <p>These eight sectors alone added 20.1 million jobs since 1990—which means that almost 6 in 10 jobs created in America in 1990–2016 has come from these eight groupings.</p> 

    <p>The largest single grouping is "food services and drinking," which added 4.9 million jobs—and that's most of the 6.3 million jobs that come under "leisure and hospitality."</p>

    <p>Then comes ambulatory health care (+4.2 million), which means doctors' and dentists' offices, outpatient medical care, and so on. Social assistance (+2.5 million) includes caring for individuals, families, children or the elderly. Hospitals and nursing and residential care make up the remainder of health care, and these have added 9.7 million jobs—meaning that "education and health" is mostly health (+9.7 million) and less so education (+1.8 million). It also means that of the 34.8 million jobs that the American economy has added since 1990, 28% have been in health care (9.7 million).</p>

    <p>The other two categories are employment services and computer systems design (effectively, IT). Together, these amounted to 3.6 million of the 9.3 million new jobs categorized under "professional and business services." The other major sub-categories (not shown) include management consulting (+830 thousand) and architecture and engineering (+470 thousand). The rest sub-categories are smaller (and include legal services, accounting, bookkeeping, etc.).</p>

    <hr><h2>Conclusion</h2><hr>

    <p>In short, the move away from manufacturing has meant a transition towards more services; and services has meant:</p> 

    <ul><li>Providing health care and social assistance (+9.7 million jobs, or 28% of total jobs growth);</li>
        <li>Eating and drinking out (+4.9 million, 14% of total);</li>
        <li>Helping companies find employees (+2 million, 6% of total);</li>
        <li>Private education (+1.8 million, 5.4%), mostly colleges and universities;</li>
        <li>Designing computer systems (+1.6 million (4.5%)); and</li>
        <li>Management consulting (+830 thousand, 2.4%).</li></p>
      </ul>

    <p>This list is not exhaustive, but, in effect, we have three major groupings: leisure, health care, and efficiency (a loose way to group education, IT, employment services and management consulting).</p>

    <p>What does this mean? There are various observations one can make about this data. First: a good share is devoted to leisure and hospitality, but these are only 18% of total job growth since 1990. Second: health care is a major employer. In fact, it is hard to understand the health care debate in the United States country without appreciating that health care is, increasingly, what Americans do-how they earn their living and provide for themselves and their families. Third: there is a sizable segment of employment focused on making things run better-seen positively, this could be understood in the context of improving efficiency. Alternatively, one could see this as interlinked with sub-standard services and business practices-inefficiencies that, ideally, should eventually disappear.</p>

    <p>And this is, perhaps, is the final observation to make: what would happen if the United States could dramatically reduce the cost of health care? What if companies were managed better; or computer systems were easier to operate; or technology allowed employers and employees to find each other more easily? What would Americans do then? Probably they would move to the next thing that needed fixing.</p> 

    <p>Yet one is left wondering: do people flock to the thing that needs fixing, or do people turning en masse to a new segment of the economy produce the kind of complexity that then requires more people to solve? Does health care cost so much because so many people work in health care or do people work in health care because that's where the money and the jobs are? Probably a bit of both. But does America have better health outcomes as a result of this massive influx of money and people? I am not sure.</p> 

    <p>In my mind, these numbers underscore the kind of stress that the traditional social contract will come under as technology improves. What are the employment consequences of reducing health care costs? What about better technology that could render many of these tasks obsolete? What about better management practices that could hit employment services or management consulting? One could easily imagine changes that would decimate the sectors that have generated the most jobs over the past three decades. Of course the economy will adapt. People will adapt. But look at the big picture and this adaptation has costs-the costs of complexity and often sub-optimal outcomes that come from lots of people seeking employment in that sector. Is there another way? I don't know.</p>
